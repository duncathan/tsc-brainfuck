# tsc-brainfuck

Made for Modfest XXIV

This project is an implementation of a brainfuck interpreter in Cave Story, using only its unmodified scripting language's behavior to create a computer capable of running the interpreter. More in-depth documentation can be found at [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_4xnSW_JgmGb5nAY8-pSSwQ4sm18thNfKH0CjRqQ9Jk/edit#). Additionally, a visualization of the memory mapping for the computer can be found at [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zwLKF7vMOlrQn6UZVupDioR-lLzWmuCgxK45dWG6p4s/edit#gid=578263378) (linked in the document).
